## Types of Signals

There are three types of signals

1. Global Signal (clock reset)

2. Data Signal (read data, write data)

   This signal is used to control read and write operations for example in a memory.

3. Control Signal (write, output enable,read address, write address)

   This signal is used to control entire operation of a system

For testing, random signals/stimulus needs to be generated for three signals.

test bench does not have ports only design code has ports
